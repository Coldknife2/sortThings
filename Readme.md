A little sorter thing made in html.

It takes an array of things you want to sort (lines separated by a carriage return)

It then compares them one by one (could use a better sorting algorithm) to help you sort your preferences

It helped me organize/vote what's my favorite game out of 300+ games. (That makes a lot of comparisons)
